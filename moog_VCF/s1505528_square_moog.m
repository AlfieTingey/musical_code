%% Pre-amble and assigning variables

% This script takes a square wave as the input u. Then we see how the
% moog filter affects the sound of the square wave. Quite simple but quite
% fun. 


% Set the sample rate, the resonant frequency, the tuning parameter, and
% the simulation duration. 

Fs = 44100;
f0 = 1000;

if f0 < 10
    error('resonant requency is too low')
end 

if f0 > 2000
    error('resonant frequency is too high')
end 

% set angular frequency

w0 = 2*pi*f0;

% Set value of r and error check r
r = 0.5;

if r <= 0
    error('r must be between 0 and 1')
end 

if r >= 1
    error('r must be between 0 and 1')
end 

% Set Tf and Nf (time in seconds and samples respectively).
Tf = 3;
Nf = Tf*Fs;

% Error check time... time can't be negative after all.
if Tf <= 0
    error('duration must be positive')
end 

% Set the input u... all zeros apart from the first value which is equal to
% 1
t = 0:1/Fs:Tf-1/Fs;
u = square(1000*t);

% Set the matrix A
A = w0*[-1,0,0,-4*r;1,-1,0,0;0,1,-1,0;0,0,1,-1];

% Set the vectors b and c
b = w0*[1,0,0,0]';
c = [0,0,0,1]';

% Set the starting vector Xf and the Identity matrix
xf = [0;0;0;0];
I = [1,0,0,0;0,1,0,0;0,0,1,0;0,0,0,1];

%% Determine k values 

% Set k equal to the time step... worked out from FD algorithm to see
% what the constant k is equal to. For certain f0 and r this value will not
% be stable. 

k = 1/(0.5*Fs);

%% Error check k using w0 and r: 

% Error check k so that stability is always good using values for w0 and r.
% Method: I took abs(1+k*eig(s1)) <= 1 and abs(1+k*eig(s3)) <= 1 and calculated
% them directly. s2 and s4 are the same calculations as s1 and s3
% respectively. I won't go through all the steps, but the general method
% was to split the eigenvalues into imaginary and real parts, re-write the
% complex number inside the magnitude as an imaginary and real part,
% take that magnitude and set it less than 1.... then re-arrange the
% resulting formula for k in terms of w0 and r. My results are this: 

% For stability of s3: k <= (1/w0)*(2(1+r^(1/4))/(1+2r^(1/4)+2r^(1/2))).
% For stability of s1: k <= (1/w0)*(2(1-r^(1/4))/(1 - 2r^(1/4) + 2r^(1/2))). 

% So these are the conditions... I think I caluclated it right but I'm not
% 100% sure. 

% Implement error check: 

if k >= (1/w0)*(2*(1+r^(1/4))/(1+2*r^(1/4)+2*r^(1/2)))
    error('This value of k will not give a stable system for eigenvalues s3 and s4')
end 

if k >= (1/w0)*(2*(1-r^(1/4))/(1 - 2*r^(1/4) + 2*r^(1/2)))
    error('This value of k will not give a stable system for eigenvalues s1 and s2')
end 

%% Error check k with eigenvalues just in case my method above doesn't quite work.

abs(1+k*eig(A));

% Error check k so that stability is always good using the eigenvalues of A
% directly. This is just incase the method above doesn't pickup all the cases of stability.
% One must always make sure there is stability. 

if max(abs(1+k*eig(A))) > 1
    error('Error: the system will not be stable')
end 

%% Start for loop for the forward method

% Set the first initial values of the output y from the first state of the
% xf vector.

yf = zeros(Nf,1);
yff = zeros(Nf,1);

% yff denotes the impulse response yforward... which is the last value in the xf
% vector.
yff(1) = xf(4);

% yf deontes y(n)
yf(1) = c'*xf;

% For loop to calculate forward method. xf changes values in each
% iteration... then we get values for yff and yf. 

for n = 2:Nf
    xf = (I + k*A)*xf + k*b*u(n-1);
    yff(n) = xf(4);
    yf(n) = c'*xf;
end

%% Start for loop for the backwards method using matrix inverse

% Set sizes of vectors and their initial states
xb = [0;0;0;0];
yb = zeros(Nf,1);
ybb = zeros(Nf,1);

% Ak is the matrix I will use in the for loop
Ak = (I - k*A);
% This is the first value of xb
xb = Ak \ (xb + k*b*u(1));
% yb is the y(n) vector
yb(1) = c'*xb;
% ybb is the ybackward vector (output)
ybb(1) = xb(4);

% Use a for loop that takes the inverse of the matrix Ak. Calculate new
% values of xb each time
for n = 2:Nf
    xb = Ak \ (xb + k*b*u(n));
    ybb(n) = xb(4);
    yb(n) = c'*xb;
end
