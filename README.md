# musical_code
This repository contains code that models many different aspects of musical technology. These include: Phase vocoder; effects such as chorus and flange; reverb modeled by different sized rooms; plate reverb; synthetic instruments; etc. All code is written in Matlab. 

I have included all .wav files that I use in the repository.
